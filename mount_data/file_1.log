Dear Community,

We have listed **Sandbox (SAND)** and **Loopring (LRC)** on CoinDCX on **November 3, 2021.

What is Sandbox (SAND)?

**The Sandbox is a blockchain-based virtual world allowing users to create, build, buy and sell digital assets in the form of a game. By combining the powers of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), the Sandbox creates a decentralized platform for a thriving gaming community.

**Project Website: **[The Sandbox Game – User-Generated Crypto & Blockchain Games

](https://www.sandbox.game/en/)**What is Loopring (LRC)?

**LRC is the Ethereum-based cryptocurrency token of Loopring, an open protocol designed for the building of decentralized crypto exchanges. Loopring’s purported goal is to combine centralized order matching with decentralized on-blockchain order settlement into a hybridized product that will take the best aspects of both centralized and decentralized exchanges.

Dear Community,

We have listed **Sandbox (SAND)** and **Loopring (LRC)** on CoinDCX on **November 3, 2021.

What is Sandbox (SAND)?

**The Sandbox is a blockchain-based virtual world allowing users to create, build, buy and sell digital assets in the form of a game. By combining the powers of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), the Sandbox creates a decentralized platform for a thriving gaming community.

**Project Website: **[The Sandbox Game – User-Generated Crypto & Blockchain Games

](https://www.sandbox.game/en/)**What is Loopring (LRC)?

**LRC is the Ethereum-based cryptocurrency token of Loopring, an open protocol designed for the building of decentralized crypto exchanges. Loopring’s purported goal is to combine centralized order matching with decentralized on-blockchain order settlement into a hybridized product that will take the best aspects of both centralized and decentralized exchanges.

Dear Community,

We have listed **Sandbox (SAND)** and **Loopring (LRC)** on CoinDCX on **November 3, 2021.

What is Sandbox (SAND)?

**The Sandbox is a blockchain-based virtual world allowing users to create, build, buy and sell digital assets in the form of a game. By combining the powers of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), the Sandbox creates a decentralized platform for a thriving gaming community.

**Project Website: **[The Sandbox Game – User-Generated Crypto & Blockchain Games

](https://www.sandbox.game/en/)**What is Loopring (LRC)?

**LRC is the Ethereum-based cryptocurrency token of Loopring, an open protocol designed for the building of decentralized crypto exchanges. Loopring’s purported goal is to combine centralized order matching with decentralized on-blockchain order settlement into a hybridized product that will take the best aspects of both centralized and decentralized exchanges.

Dear Community,

We have listed **Sandbox (SAND)** and **Loopring (LRC)** on CoinDCX on **November 3, 2021.

What is Sandbox (SAND)?

**The Sandbox is a blockchain-based virtual world allowing users to create, build, buy and sell digital assets in the form of a game. By combining the powers of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), the Sandbox creates a decentralized platform for a thriving gaming community.

**Project Website: **[The Sandbox Game – User-Generated Crypto & Blockchain Games

](https://www.sandbox.game/en/)**What is Loopring (LRC)?

**LRC is the Ethereum-based cryptocurrency token of Loopring, an open protocol designed for the building of decentralized crypto exchanges. Loopring’s purported goal is to combine centralized order matching with decentralized on-blockchain order settlement into a hybridized product that will take the best aspects of both centralized and decentralized exchanges.

Dear Community,

We have listed **Sandbox (SAND)** and **Loopring (LRC)** on CoinDCX on **November 3, 2021.

What is Sandbox (SAND)?

**The Sandbox is a blockchain-based virtual world allowing users to create, build, buy and sell digital assets in the form of a game. By combining the powers of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), the Sandbox creates a decentralized platform for a thriving gaming community.

**Project Website: **[The Sandbox Game – User-Generated Crypto & Blockchain Games

](https://www.sandbox.game/en/)**What is Loopring (LRC)?

**LRC is the Ethereum-based cryptocurrency token of Loopring, an open protocol designed for the building of decentralized crypto exchanges. Loopring’s purported goal is to combine centralized order matching with decentralized on-blockchain order settlement into a hybridized product that will take the best aspects of both centralized and decentralized exchanges.
